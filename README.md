# Network_Traffic_work
This project contains analysis and predictions of download bitrate (DL_bitrate) for different video resolutions (360p, 720p, and 1080p). The goal is to predict the download bitrate using different forecasting approaches and methods.

### The project is structured in a Jupyter notebook (teste.ipynb), which contains the following sections:

- Importing Libraries: Importing the necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization.
- Loading Data: Reading and loading the download bitrate data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis of the data to understand its structure and main characteristics.
- Download Bitrate Prediction: Applying different prediction methods to the download bitrate.
  1 - Historical Average
  2 - Last Known Value
  3 - Seasonal Naive
Results Visualization: Plotting the prediction results for visual comparison and analysis.
